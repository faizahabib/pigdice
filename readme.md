## Description {
  ME faizahabib, I develope this application for my 5th project  is pig dice game. this is very intresting game .  in pig dice game This is a simple dice game where two players have the chance to roll the dice to try and achieve a score of 100.

The rules of the game are:

When the player rolls a 2 - 6, the dice score is added to their turn total and they can continue to play.
When a player rolls a 1, their total score reverts to 0 and it becomes the next player's turn.
When the player chooses to "hold"(pass their turn), their turn total is added to their total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
The player who first scores 100 or more points wins the game.
Try your luck!!!.}
